<h1> IBM K9</h1>
The IBM K-9 bot's body is divided into 3 parts: the chassis, the legs and the head, where each of them were designed for the sake of practicality, manoeuverability and compactness.
Unless otherwise specified, the material used are PLA filament, which were 3D printed for the sake of rapid prototyping and bespoke modifications.

<h2>Legs</h2>
The mechanism of the legs is controlled by two servos, each controlling the shoulder (upper half of the leg) and the elbow (lower half of the leg).
The torque of the shoulder is controlled directly via the servo, whose circular attachment is slotted into the shoulder and fastened with a screw.
The torque of the elbow is transfered via the links which are attached between the servo and the elbow.
Finally, the feet of the chassis is a squash ball cut into half. The advantage of the squash ball is the higher friction surface and elasticity, preventing the K-9 from slipping while walking towards the user.
