## Milestone and its respective deadlines + content

1. Create subteams & organisation/roles (2nd - 7th May)
    1. Software
        1. API w/ chatbot
        2. API w/ news/music/podcast etc.
        3. Movement (Servos/Control)
        4. Computer vision
    2. Hardware
        1. Chassis
        2. Electronics
2. Create Parts list - TBD after meeting with supervisor (7th) - Deadline 10th May
3. Ordering parts - Plan to order everything by the 10th (Deliver within a week ideally)
4. Software
    1. Chatbot API with microphone on laptop (1 wk)
    2. Finding podcast & news API (1 wk)
    3. Computer vision with camera (2 wks)
5. Hardware
    1. Completing Chassis (27th May)
    2. Servo Config and control (27th May)
    3. Breadboard prototype circuit for additional sensors (20th May)
    - Possible delays from broken circuits/reprint chassis part
6. Integration (start 28th May  - 3rd June) 
    1. State machine/workflow of the bot (walking, playing music etc)
    2. Uploading different software parts on pi & debug [1 week]
    3. Movement + obstacle avoidance debugging with software/sensors [1.5 weeks]
    - In case of chassis delay - software team should start on the pi itself and integrating mic/speaker
7. Final Integration (start 13th June - 20th June)
    1. Test runs and final adjustments
    2. edge case if there is
